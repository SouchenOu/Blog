This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.





NextJs
------


Next.js is a backend framework which is based on React.

Everything we can do in React we can also do in Next.js – with some additional features like routing, API calls, authentication, and more. We don’t have these features in React. Instead, we have to install some external libraries and dependencies – like React Router for routing in a single page React app, for example.

But in Next.js, things are different. We don’t have to rely on external libraries to get these kinds of things done. They come built into the package when we create a Next.js app.

This is the main reason why a Next.js app is different from a traditional React app.


Some informations:
------------------


when we create a folder with () for example (groupAuth) , if we want to search for the files in this folder we should not write Auth in the path for example

dashboard/groupAuth/login --> false
dashboard/login --> true  (access directly)
